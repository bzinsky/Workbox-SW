## Description

This a text editor that runs in the browser. It is a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. It features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.
It also uses a package called "idb", which is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API. It features a number of methods that are useful for storing and retrieving data, and is used by companies like Google and Mozilla.
